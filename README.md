# autocomplete.c
ESC190 Project 1 - Autocomplete.c

Code is run through autocomplete.c file. txt and .h files must be in the same directory.

This project makes use of C's memory allocation for a block of structs to store text file data, and then uses edge case binary search to return a match to a substring (autocomplete) from the sorted data.
